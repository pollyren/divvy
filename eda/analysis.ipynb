There is a large shift from classic to electric bikes between 2021 and 2022 for both member and casual riders. In fact, there were more e-bike rides than classic bike rides from casual users in 2022. With the 2023 data up until May, this shift toward e-bike usage also appears to persist, with even member riders more frequently using electric bikes than classic bikes. Electric bikes were first introduced to the fleet at the end of July 2020, so it is interesting to observe its changes in popularity over the years.
